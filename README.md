# Verifiable AI Agents

## Project Abstract
This research addresses the critical verification gap in AI-blockchain interactions by developing a comprehensive zero-knowledge proof framework for AI agent actions. As AI systems increasingly interface with blockchain protocols, they introduce novel trust challenges where stakeholders cannot verify computational integrity without exposing proprietary models or sensitive data. We propose utilizing advanced zkVMs to generate cryptographic attestations for AI agent operations, enabling trustless verification while maintaining computational privacy and establishing graduated security guarantees appropriate to risk levels.

## Problem Statement
The integration of AI systems with blockchain technology introduces novel trust and security challenges that existing frameworks inadequately address. While blockchain offers transparency and immutability, AI agents introduce computational opacity where stakeholders cannot verify that an agent performed its intended computation correctly without revealing proprietary models or sensitive data. This verification gap presents significant risks:

- Users cannot distinguish between legitimate AI-driven actions and those manipulated by system operators or attackers
- Smart contract interactions triggered by AI agents lack computational attestation, creating uncertainty about decision provenance
- The absence of cryptographic verification enables potential exploitation through "AI rugging" where system behaviors diverge from stated purposes

These challenges are particularly acute in high-stakes domains where AI agents manage financial assets, govern protocols, or interface with critical infrastructure on-chain. Current solutions relying solely on reputation or economic security models provide insufficient guarantees for many applications.

## Research Objectives
This research aims to develop a comprehensive framework for generating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs for AI agent computations using advanced zkVMs (Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines). Specifically, we will:

- Identify optimal constraint placement within AI agent architectures to balance security with practical efficiency
- Design specialized circuit constraints for verifying key AI operations including:
  - Input validation ensuring data integrity and authorization
  - Computation integrity verifying adherence to predefined algorithms
  - Policy compliance confirming actions follow established rules
  - State transition verification ensuring valid operation sequences
- Evaluate performance trade-offs between proof generation efficiency, on-chain verification costs, and security guarantees across different zkVM implementations
- Develop a hierarchical security framework mapping appropriate verification methods to corresponding risk levels

## Outcomes
This project will significantly advance the Ethereum ecosystem by:

- Enabling trustless AI-driven smart contract interactions with cryptographic verification
- Mitigating AI-specific MEV and exploitation vulnerabilities in on-chain AI systems
- Establishing open standards for verifiable AI agent computation on blockchain
- Creating infrastructure for decentralized AI governance with formal verification
- Reducing reliance on centralized AI providers by enabling verifiable third-party computation
- Supporting the emerging zkML (Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning) ecosystem on Ethereum
